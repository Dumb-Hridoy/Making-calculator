# Making a calculator using Java
### Here I'm gonna create a simple calculator using java arithmetic operators and switch-break syntaxes. ðŸš€

## How its works?
### First of all you've to input the numbers which you want to calculate. You've to take any two numbers and then you've to input the arithmetic operator you want to calculate by. Here I'm using 1 for '+', 2 for '-', 3 for '*', 4 for '/' and 5 for '%'.

## Process example:
### If you input two numbers like 2 and 3 and then you've to take an operator like in example I've taken a '+' operator which symbolised by the '1' number. So I take 2 and 3 and 1 for '+' operator respectively. So the output/result will be 2 + 3 = 5.
